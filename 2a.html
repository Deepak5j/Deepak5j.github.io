					<div class="conhead">INITIATION
					</div>
					<div class="con">
						Dhruva was born to a couple, <span style="color:yellow">Shyam</span> and <span style="color:yellow">Radha</span>. Two <span style="color:yellow">trapeze artists</span> who used to perform in <span style="color:yellow">Jupiter Circus</span> situated on the outskirts of <span style="color:yellow">Rajnagar</span>. Dhruva was brought up in the circus itself. Growing up amongst the tigers, elephants, and other pet animals of the circus, <span style="color:yellow">Dhruva learnt to communicate with the animals</span>. Dhruva was loved by every Jupiter Circus performer, started learning their respective skills from them. <span style="color:yellow">Strongman Hercules</span> taught him body building. <span style="color:yellow">Ringmaster taught</span> him how to control animals. He learned to throw knives from the knife thrower, along with shooting and bike stunts. At the age of <span style="color:yellow">14</span>, he started performing in Jupiter Circus shows and his stunning performances helped Jupiter to become a hugely popular circus.
						</p>
						<p>
							When Jupiter circus was at its peak, the owner of <span style="color:yellow">Global circus</span> hired goons to destroy the entire circus because of suffering huge losses in business. Boss, the owner of rival Globe Circus, hatched a conspiracy to destroy Jupiter Circus. He hired goons to destroy the entire circus. He sent Jubisko, his strongman and Bond, a sharpshooter to do the task. <span style="color:yellow">Jubisko</span> burnt the Jupiter Circus killing everyone in it including Dhruva's parents.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="color:yellow">Dhruva was not in the camp</span> at that time and returned only to find out the charred bodies of his parents and his loved one’s. 
						</p>
						<p>
							There <span style="color:yellow">he overheard the goons talking to the owner of the rival circus about the success of their plan and realized the reason behind the tragedy</span>. With tears in his eyes and revenge in his heart <span style="color:yellow">Dhruva vowed to take revenge</span> and eliminate the evil from the society. Very soon put all the accused behind the bars. The series of events that followed resulted in the shutting down of Globe Circus as well. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Highly impressed by such amazing skills at such a young age, the police commissioner of Rajnagar <span style="color:yellow">I.G. Rajan Mehra</span> adopted Dhruva, and since then Dhruva has become an integral part of Mehra's life. Since then <span style="color:yellow">Dhruva has dedicated his life to fight against criminals and to erase the element of crime</span>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Dhruva chose to carry on his struggle against crime choosing Rajnagar as the base of his operation.
						</p>
						<p>
						</p>
						<p>
							Dhruva comes out as a humble, gentle and down to earth kind of personality. He is very softspoken and mildmannered guy who respects his elders. He is always well dressed with buttoned collar and sports well kept hairs.
						</p>
						<p>
							Being a hero with <span style="color:yellow">no superpowers and no alter ego</span>, Dhruva was probably the closest thing to reality in a world of comic book superheroes, a character that children could relate to, a character that children could try to emulate.
						</p>
						<p>
							Dhruva has been shown to have <span style="color:yellow">utmost respect for human life</span> and <span style="color:yellow">has vowed not to take a human life ever</span>. Dhruva never takes law in his hands and always works in <span style="color:yellow">conjunction with the law enforcing bodies</span>. He believes that as a protector of the city of Rajnagar, his only job is to catch the criminal alive and hand him over to the police and the court shall decide the punishment for the criminal. As a result, there is always an air of uneasiness between Dhruva and some of his allies including <span style="color:red">Black Cat</span> and <span style="color:red">Doga who don't think twice before killing a criminal</span>, and he always makes it a point not to let them take the law in their hands in front of his eyes. Dhruva also <span style="color:yellow">doesn't hit a woman in principle</span>. Even while facing a female enemy, he tries to disarm her without actually hitting or inflicting physical harm to her. Dhruva received such strong moral codes from his biological parents during his childhood and subsequently during his adolescence from his foster parents.
						</p>
						<p>
							Dhruva has also been shown to be a man of his words and a onewoman man. Though lot of girls swoon on him including his very close friend <span style="color:yellow">Richa (Black Cat)</span>, who loves him very deeply, Dhruva has always made it very clear to her that his heart belongs only to Natasha, his first love.
						<p>
						<p>
							Inside this tough superhero exterior, Dhruva has a sense of humor too. Dhruva often indulges in healthy sibling rivalry, legpulling and playing pranks with his fostersister Shweta and loves his foster family very much.
						</p>
						<p>
							Dhruva has never been shown to be a drinker or a smoker. Dhruva has been shown to be a vegetarian.
						</p>

					<div class="conhead">COMMANDO HEADQUARTERS
					</div>
					<div class="con">
								Dhruva is also the <span style="color:yellow">founder</span> and <span style="color:yellow">captain</span> of a government approved crime fighting organisation "<span style="color:yellow">Commando Force</span>", which has earned Dhruva the titles such as Captain Dhruva and Super Commando. Dhruva is also a master of disguise. Dhruva has always had full support of the police department and full access to all police records and classified documents, not only because his foster father Rajan Mehra is the Inspector General of Police but also because Dhruva has always had utmost respect for the law enforcing bodies and has never taken law in his hands. Later, being a member of <span style="color:yellow">Brahmand Rakshak</span>, Dhruva, along with all the other members of the team, was honorarily awarded the powers and rights equivalent to a Commissioner of Police
							</P>
							<p>
								<span style="color:yellow">Commando headquarters</span> is the base of Commando Force located in Rajnagar. It is the place from where
								Commando Force operates. It is equipped with state of the art technology and computer system. Its system can perform various functions that include, but are not limited to, <span style="color:yellow">facial recognition, finger print matching, DNA matching, remote hacking of enemy's system and global surveillance through satellite imaging</span>. Commando headquarters' system also keeps the data on every criminal, can access police records as well interpol files on request.
							</p>
							<p>

								Teenagers residing in various cities of India receive special training at the headquarters from the Commando Force and then sent back to their respective homes. These trained junior cadets have special protocol to report any ongoing crime to commando headquarters and not getting involved themselves unless they are sure they can handle it. Dhruva has got surveillance cameras installed all over Rajnagar streets which are monitored at the headquarters for suspicious activities. Information on any suspicious activity caught by cameras or junior cadets, if requiring Dhruva's attention, is channelled to Dhruva on his startransmitter. Dhruva himself patrols the city streets every night on his special motorbike. Dhruva's unyielding dedication towards keeping his city safe has earned him the title of 'Rajnagar Ka Rakhwala'.
							</p>
					</div>
						<div class="conhead">EQUIPMENTS
						</div>
						<div class="con">
							Starblades, starline, motorbike and utility belt.
							<p>
								Dhruva shoots <span style="color:yellow">starblades from his right hand bracelet</span>. <span style="color:yellow">Starline on the other hand is a thin rope made of nylosteel which can not be cut, burnt or broken easily</span>. Starline is attached to a star shaped grappling hook at one end. Dhruva uses his left hand bracelet, which contains starline, like a grapple gun and can climb up or swing from one skyscraper to another.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dhruva's preferred mode of transport is his <span style="color:yellow">special motorbike</span>. The bike is specially designed and optimised to suit his needs. Dhruva's bike is remote control enabled, so that he can start and operate his bike even from a distance. Dhruva's bike has undergone innumerable design changes from the old fashioned 1980s design to a modernised sports bike look. Among all designs one common factor has been that the bike never had any attached firearm to it. It is said that the sound of the engine of Dhruva's bike is unique and different from any other bike and can be easily identified.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dhruva also owns a <span style="color:yellow">star helicopter</span>, a star plane (a literally star shaped plane painted half blue and half yellow), a sonic jet and a starboat. The only significant omission from Dhruva's fleet of transport vehicles is a car which he has never owned.
							</p>
							<p>
								Starblade, starline and motorbike are so significant to the character's identity that often, even before Dhruva himself breaks into a crime scene, a flurry of starblades, a starline or the sound of Dhruva's special bike announce the arrival of Dhruva.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dhruva's <span style="color:yellow">utility belt</span> is one of the most significant and defining characteristic of the character's appearanceas well the character's most useful and important tool in his crime fighting sojourn. Dhruva's belt has evolved over the years from a simple leather belt to a leather utility belt with pouches to a metallic utilitybelt. In its current version, Dhruva's utility belt is a metallic belt with inbuilt locking system to make sure that no one can easily pull it off or cut it as against his older leather belt. The star shaped buckle has an inbuilt <span style="color:yellow">transmitter</span> which enables Dhruva to stay in contact with commando headquarters, police force andeven some of his allies including Chandika. Dhruva is known to carry a lot of utility items in his beltpockets. The various items that he has been shown to carry in his utility belt at various times include, butare not limited to, <span style="color:yellow">spare cartridges for starbladesand starlines,acid capsules, signal flares, star cuffs (starshaped handcuffs), a makeup kit and many more items</span>. Dhruva also carries a <span style="color:yellow">special transmitter fixed at'Brahmand Rakshak' frequency which enables him to stay in contact with the Brahmand Rakshak headquarters</span> as well as the other members of Brahmand Rakshak team. On some occasions he has been shown to carry a separate Brahmand Rakshak transmitter while on the other occasions it has been shown to be integrated with Dhruva's personal startransmitter. Dhruva also carries a <span style="color:yellow">radiation sensor</span> which is either fitted in his collar button or sometimes in his belt and blinks whenever there is threat of hazardous level of radiation exposure.
